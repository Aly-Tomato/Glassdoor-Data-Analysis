Alternatively, you can opt for a traditional HMO style plan with $40 co-pays to see anyone (GP or specialist) - but then you aren't allowed to contribute to the HSA.

3436791560,food,Free Lunch or Snacks,"Best: Free snacks whenever you want.

3423377868,retirement,401K Plan,"Only a 3% match of 401K contributions, and it takes many years to be fully vested. I would expect more of a match and a shorter vesting period (2 years would be reasonable,  5+ feels ridiculous)."

3364679563,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"The PTO is nothing special. It's on par with other hospital systems, though very low and limited in the first year. Directors are front loaded with all PTO at the beginning of the year, while the lowly worker bees must accrue it each pay period. 

Very tough to get time off during the holiday season if you're a clinician and there's high census.

It's also tough to praise the PTO policy when, in practice, it's often demeaning to employees. There's an attendance demerit system where if you call in sick you get a mark against you. If your child happens to get sick later that week or month, that's another mark against you and you'll be reprimanded for prioritizing your or your family's health over the health of your patients. (Which ultimately is prioritizing the health of everyone, by staying home sick.) This practice encourages staff to come to work sick. This may not have been the intention of the one-bucket PTO policy, but it's definitely the reality of it in practice. "

Very tough to get time off during the holiday season if you're a clinician and there's high census.

It's also tough to praise the PTO policy when, in practice, it's often demeaning to employees. There's an attendance demerit system where if you call in sick you get a mark against you. If your child happens to get sick later that week or month, that's another mark against you and you'll be reprimanded for prioritizing your or your family's health over the health of your patients. (Which ultimately is prioritizing the health of everyone, by staying home sick.) This practice encourages staff to come to work sick. This may not have been the intention of the one-bucket PTO policy, but it's definitely the reality of it in practice. "

3464997991,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"For employees working hourly contracts you aren't offered any PTO or holiday pay. If you can't work a day because of your office being closed for a holiday you are just out that much pay for the week.

3261095125,retirement,401K Plan,It’s like any normal 401K plan... Not much else to say... This answer needs to be a 20 word minimum.

3465365736,retirement,401K Plan,Standard 401 Plan choices with Wells Fargo.  I wish all consulting companies would have a 401k Plan. 
3465365736,dental,Dental Insurance,"Not a usual coverage level with only $1000 per year coverage.  I wish it would be better plan.  Oh, well but if you select HSA Account then you can set aside additional funding for yourself and children."

3465786614,health,Health Insurance,"By far this was the only decent benefit offered by Capital Health. Comprehensive coverage is a bit more expensive (around $55/month), but worth it. Company is Aetna, it's not the greatest but it's not the worst either."
3465786614,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"Pretty much impossible to get any paid time off. Even if your requests are submitted months in advance, management will still reject them because they are ""short-staffed,"" but will not hesitate to schedule their own vacations on those dates. Staff should not have to bear the burden of this inadequacy, as it is entirely a management created problem. This leads to what I have alluded to in previous reviews, i.e. poor staff morale driving people to quit.
Also no paid sick days. And administrators give you a hard time when you call in sick. It's a state law that workers have to be granted paid sick time. Capital Health's policies are decades behind."

Turns out this is perfect for what they are doing, Low pay means high turnover which is exactly what they want due to the fact that as people leave their pension money stays. So high turnover is great for the pension and the pension is great for the 4% of employees that stick around to take it. I know that a pyramid scheme looks like when I see it.  "

Very tough to get time off during the holiday season if you're a clinician and there's high census.

It's also tough to praise the PTO policy when, in practice, it's often demeaning to employees. There's an attendance demerit system where if you call in sick you get a mark against you. If your child happens to get sick later that week or month, that's another mark against you and you'll be reprimanded for prioritizing your or your family's health over the health of your patients. (Which ultimately is prioritizing the health of everyone, by staying home sick.) This practice encourages staff to come to work sick. This may not have been the intention of the one-bucket PTO policy, but it's definitely the reality of it in practice. "

3426671517,retirement,401K Plan,As a non-profit NWEA offers a 403(b) which acts just like a 401k.   NWEA contirbutes 15% of your salary into the 403(b).  The current plan also lets you contribute some of your own money into either a ROTH option or the regular 403(b)

3447906272,retirement,401K Plan,"Only a 3% match of 401K contributions, and it takes many years to be fully vested. I would expect more of a match and a shorter vesting period (2 years would be reasonable,  5+ feels ridiculous)."

3466896633,health,Health Insurance,It is almost $100 a paycheck with a non-smoker and BMI discount. Then there is still a deductible and copays to pay before meeting the out of pocket. There are many companies with better plans that are not 80/20 coverage.

3461442037,health,Health Insurance,Overpriced - its not a good thing if you get sick a lot. Its a reason why people say health is wealth.
3461442037,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,Vacation time has to be accrued. Management can release a certain amount of pto to you but you better be good at explaining why you need time off from a job you didn't work at long enough.

3397771372,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"you accumulate more PTO each year, but can only carry up to 1 year's worth of PTO to the next.  That is if you use no PTO on year 1, it will all carry to year 2, but you'll have to use some by year 2 or you'll lose some."

3362893445,health,Health Insurance,The best thing about health insurance was the high deductible plan which allowed you to use the HSA plan.

3362893445,pension,Pension Plan,"Pension plans are going away for a reason, but AFCU thinks they have it all figured out. They pay less than most because they put money in ""your"" pension. Turns out this is perfect for what they are doing, Low pay means high turnover which is exactly what they want due to the fact that as people leave their pension money stays. So high turnover is great for the pension and the pension is great for the 4% of employees that stick around to take it. I know that a pyramid scheme looks like when I see it.  "

Say, if you are earning $2000/month, and you work for UCLA for 5 years and retire, then you got $250/month...10 years, you got $500/month. Pension is very rare now. It’s more stable than 401k."

3386087660,health,Health Insurance,"they dont train their employees 1 on 1, they do it via webex, for only 2 weeks, and than throw you to the wolves"

3464830300,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"Not very generous.  When I was working here, the max vacation time per year was 3 weeks.  That's obviously not even one vacation per quarter.

3460553243,health,Health Insurance,"For a non-profit that does healthcare all day everyday, my health insurance should not have been over $80 a week as a single insured person."
3460553243,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,The fact that all holidays come out of your PTO balance and that you cannot use any of the hours until they are accrued is just ridiculous.

3423686492,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"Some people feel like an unlimited PTO policy means that their boss is looking over their shoulder. I feel like I can take time off and as long as I get my job done well, there's no problem. Yes, there's opportunity for abuse, but I haven't felt pressured to avoid using PTO."

3332582043,pension,Pension Plan,"Pension plans are going away for a reason, but AFCU thinks they have it all figured out. They pay less than most because they put money in ""your"" pension. Turns out this is perfect for what they are doing, Low pay means high turnover which is exactly what they want due to the fact that as people leave their pension money stays. So high turnover is great for the pension and the pension is great for the 4% of employees that stick around to take it. I know that a pyramid scheme looks like when I see it.  "

3442808285,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"Didn't tell me about the XMas shut down and had to go 30 hours in the hole and with the poor accurate rate, with the next's years XMAS break, would have gotten maybe 10 hours during the year to myself, "
3434478979,health,Health Insurance,They stopped giving any money for opting out.

3453689540,health,Health Insurance,deductibles are high but flexibile spending and health saving accounts are offered
3453689540,retirement,401K Plan,"Company does offer an annual profit sharing that gets paid into the 401k, but there is no traditional company match which I feel would be the only enhancement that is needed, otherwise it's a 5 star program."
3413325703,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off, Gracious time off. Receive 5 hours every paycheck. All PTO and no sick time.
3413325703,health,Health Insurance,Good Benefits over all. I am a single individual. Not sure how a it would benefit a family with children.

3456318885,retirement,401K Plan,"standard match of 5%, good options "
3296010395,health,Health Insurance,It's one of their better perks. They have some pretty low deductible options. Their vision and dental insurance is really good. They currently use UnitedHealth.
3296010395,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,You get two weeks right away and after 3 years you get 3 weeks. That's the cap. It doesn't carry over and that time includes sick days. They should allow employees to work from home when the weather creates dangerous conditions or when someone has a sick child. They provide the equipment for it but don't allow it.  No administrative days off either.
3296010395,holidays,Paid Holidays,"You get New Years day, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, and Labor Day off every year. If Christmas  or the 4th of July falls on a weekday, you get it off but if it's on a weekend, you don't get any additional time. They usually give the day after Thanksgiving off but they don't tell you until shortly before so you can't really make plans. You're supposed to be very grateful if you get it off..."
3456087432,health,Health Insurance,The health insurance coverage meets my needs
3456087432,retirement,401K Plan,"The 401(k) match was laughable, and the period in which one becomes completely vested is 5-6 years. "
3456087432,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"You accrue 16 days a year. A lot of the days you'd want to take during the holidays will be denied, though, because other people will also want to take them then."
3296286018,health,Health Insurance,Standard package. Same as most companies
3296286018,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,They provide less vacation & less paid time off.

3436148730,health,Health Insurance,different levels of health packages 
3455572268,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,"Ok, but no PTO cashout which, basically adds up to thievery from employees.   When you are worked to death and it is hard to take any time off because there is no one to cover your shift you build up a ton of PTO and then lose it."
3455572268,health,Health Insurance,The health insurance is really good. Low deductible.
3455572268,retirementPlan,Retirement Plan,Good plan-good management of 401K.

3461112515,health,Health Insurance,What they offer is more then the average person could afford
3461112515,retirement,401K Plan,"The company offers 401K, but they will not match it"
3461112515,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,You get 8.5 hr of vacation for every month. And you can use them only after 6 months
3437393835,health,Health Insurance,Overall great benefits and partnership with other companies 
3437393835,retirement,401K Plan,They do company match up to 5% I think

3466996481,retirement,401K Plan,"Very low matching, i think it was only 2%."
3395004077,health,Health Insurance,$80 co-pay is not great
3395004077,retirement,401K Plan,"They offer one, but matching from the employer is less than most companies I’ve seen. "
3395004077,vacation,Vacation & Paid Time Off,This is very fair and you can accumulate more time off as you stay with the company
3453161646,health,Health Insurance,"Decent coverage, it all depends if you pick HMO or PPO."
3453161646,retirement,401K Plan,"When you put in 6%, Co-op puts in 7%"

3446004196,health,Health Insurance,Company pays majority of premium.  Choices limited to PPO or High Deductible (with HRA) with Anthem or HMO with Kaiser.  A health savings account  for the high-deductible plan would be better
3446004196,retirement,401K Plan,Instant vesting on safe harbor match.  Choice of funds are decent.  Plan administrated by Prudential with weak online interface.  No true up on employer match and no passive/automated advisor option available.

3118945382,retirement,401K Plan,The 401k benefit seems pretty standard. There is a match at 50% contribution up to 4%. The downside is the vesting is 3 years so the match doesn't count for anything unless you stay for over 3 years
